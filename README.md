## How to Publish MQTT Messages Locally

*After cloning the repository locally, make sure you run 'npm install' to bring in all of the necessary packages.*

<br />

Have three different terminals/command prompts available:

Step 0: Download & install Mosquitto (MQTT broker)
- https://mosquitto.org/download/

Step 1: In one terminal, start the mosquitto session and open it on a port
- For Windows, use this guide: https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application_development/9781787287815/1/ch01lvl1sec13/installing-a-mosquitto-broker-on-windows
- For macOS, run the following command: /usr/local/sbin/mosquitto -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

Step 2: In a second terminal, start the web app from within the root directory with the following command
- Windows and macOS: npm start

Step 3: In a third terminal, publish a message to the mqtt topic with the following command
- Windows and macOS: mosquitto_pub -t '*your topic name here*' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -m '*your message here*'

Step 4: Refresh your browser and you should see the message you just published with the mosquitto_pub command
