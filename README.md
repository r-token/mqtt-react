## How to Publish MQTT Messages Locally

Have three different terminals/command prompts available:

Step 1: Download & install Mosquitto (MQTT client)
- https://mosquitto.org/download/

Step 2: In one terminal, start the mosquitto session and open it on a port using the following command
- /usr/local/sbin/mosquitto -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

Step 3: In a second terminal, start the web app from within the root directory with the following command
- npm start

Step 4: In a third terminal, publish a message to the mqtt topic with the following command
- mosquitto_pub -t '*your topic name here*' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -m '*your message here*'

Step 5: Refresh your browser and you should see the message you just published with the mosquitto_pub command
